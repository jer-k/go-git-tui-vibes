# go-git-tui-vibes

This repository was vibe coded by Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Zed on May 8th 2025. It was done as a learning experience so that I could familiarize myself with letting the agent do all the coding. The end result isn't exactly as I had imagined but it got decently close.

The original prompt was

> This is a blank project called `go-git-tui`. I don't have a ton of experience
> with Go, but I've been wanting to learn. What I want to build is a TUI (Terminal UI) application that has one function, which is to view the git
> commits of a repository in a carousel fashion. Imagine each commit being a fixed width wide and we display all the information about it vertically.
> At the bottom of the box, I want a colored dot. If you take the 6 characters of a commit sha, it is a valid hex color so the colored dot will be
> based off that. I want all the dots displayed on the screen to have a line connecting them together. The line should be a gradient of the two hex
> colors. Finally, we will show as many commits as possible on the screen (based on the width of each commit box and the width of the terminal window)
> and users should be able to scroll using the arrow keys.
>
>Before you write any code, can you come up with a plan for implementing this project?

This is the result
